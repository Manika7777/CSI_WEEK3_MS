# 🛳 Titanic Dataset - Data Visualization (Google Colab Project)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization on the famous **Titanic dataset** using Python in Google Colab. The goal is to uncover hidden insights about survival patterns based on various features such as age, gender, class, and family size.

## 📁 Dataset Used

- **Filename**: `Titanic-Dataset.csv`
- **Source**: Kaggle
- The dataset includes information on:
  - Passenger class, age, sex
  - Number of siblings/spouses (`SibSp`) and parents/children (`Parch`)
  - Survival status

## 📊 Visualizations Included

### ✅ 1. Passenger Class Distribution
- Shows the number of passengers in each class (1 = Upper, 2 = Middle, 3 = Lower)
- **Visualization**:

### ✅ 2. Survival by Gender
- Compares male and female survival counts

### ✅ 3. Survival by Age Group
- Age groups like: Child, Teenager, Adult, Middle-aged, Senior

### ✅ 4. Survival by Family Size
- Combines `SibSp` and `Parch` to analyze survival chances with/without family

### ✅ 5. Correlation Heatmap
- Displays relationships between numerical variables

## 📌 Insights from Analysis

- Most passengers belonged to the **third class (lower class)**.
- **Women and children** had a higher survival rate.
- **Passengers traveling with small families** had better survival odds than those alone or in large groups.
